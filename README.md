# Multiscale
A girder plugin and client for our multiscale mechanics calculations.

Installation instructions for both the client and the server can be found [here](setup.md).

Take a look at the [samples](https://github.com/psavery/multiscale/releases/tag/samples) for examples of how to run the client.
